                            Snow, what a lovely representation of the solid aggregate state of H<sub>2</sub>O!
                            <br />
                            There are so many different kinds of snow: Fresh, Boot-Packed, Blue, Corn, Dust On Crust, Firm, Groomed, Hard-Packed, Slough, Chowder, and everyone's favorite: Champagne Powder.
                        </h3>
                        <h5>
                            But nevermind all 99 words for snow, here is the important part: Every snow flake is unique and so are you... Wait! Stop! My gosh, this is waaaay too cheesy.

                            Here is what I wanted to say: Champagne Powder isn't the same without you. So we are making a trip to SÃ¼dtirol in March. And you are coming with us!
